Exploratory testing:
1. Happy path with random data
2. Happy path with edge cases: long names, special symbols
3. Validation check - I shouldn't be able to submit with required fileds empty
4. More comprehensive validation checks on the fields - like symbols for phoen number etc
5. Try to login with created user

One issue found (or expected behaviour):
Cannot use '+' in email field. this prevents me to automate the email functionality because for every test run we have
to use new unique email or to delete the data from the DB (I don't have access neither to db or end point for this action)
according to the  RFC 5322: Internet Message Format  "+" is a valid email character. So there is either strong busness case
for this behaviour or this is a bug.
